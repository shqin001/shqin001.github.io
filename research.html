          <p class="paper_abs">
            <b>Abstract:</b> The structure of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) generates significant information
            asymmetry for public investors and provides a special role for its sponsors. Leveraging the unique
            characteristics of SPACs, this study re-examines the debate surrounding managers’ network centrality and its
            impact on M&A outcomes. Specifically, we show that while few characteristics can explain SPACs’ returns,
            sponsors’ private equity and venture capital connections, measured by their network centrality, explain a
            large portion of return variation in the cross-section. A one standard deviation increase in sponsors’
            network centrality leads to a 2.2% higher merger and acquisition success probability and a 1.2% higher
            post-merger monthly abnormal return. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced among SPAC sponsors
            with greater stakes in post-merger entities. We attribute this outperformance of firms with high managerial
            PE network centrality to superior deal sourcing, fundraising abilities, and higher equity ownership that
            alleviates agency costs. Overall, we show that when network connections reflect managers’ value-creation
            ability more than their rent-seeking capacity, these connections can add value to SPACs’ deals and help to
            alleviate information asymmetry and associated moral hazard issues despite the general underperformance of
            SPACs after business combinations.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
                <b><i>Competition and Kickback</i></b> (with Chen Lin, Xiang Shao, and Jianfei Zhu)
          </p>
          <p class="paper_abs">
            <b>Abstract:</b> Developing two novel measures, this paper studies how competition affects kickbacks. Using unique
            granular data from the pharmaceutical industry, we are able to test this fundamental question by accurately
            measuring kickbacks from records of pharmaceutical payments to physicians and constructing a time-varying
            competition measure at the firm level through identifying the breakthroughs of rival firms' drug projects
            for the same disease targets. We find that our project-based competition measure is positively associated
            with pharmaceutical firms’ kickback payments to physicians. We also show that firms pay physicians more
            strategically in terms of the nature and forms of payment. We provide empirical evidence that kickback
            payment is related to higher physician prescriptions and that the promotional effect of pharmaceutical
            kickbacks is stronger when competition is more intense. Moreover, we document that biopharma firms increase
            kickback payments for addictive drugs relatively more when facing greater competition, which leads to
            increased addictive drug prescriptions. Two possible channels underlie our findings: firms need to
            compensate for the value loss of the competition-affected drug projects and firms need to obtain funding to
            support new/ongoing projects in unaffected drug indications.

                <b><i>Barbarian or Vanguard? : Private Equity Buyout and Physician Opioid Prescription</i></b> (with Chen Lin, Xiang
            Shao, and Jianfei Zhu)
          </p>

          <p class="paper_abs">
            <b>Abstract:</b> The paper studies how PE buyouts of physician groups affect physician opioid prescriptions. Using
            a difference-in-differences approach, we find that physicians in the PE-owned physician groups relatively
            decreased their opioid prescription rate after the buyout. More importantly, we document three main channels
            of this effect. First, we show that PE affects physician opioid prescription through the financial
            constraint channel. The reduction effect of PE buyout is stronger for PE firms with less financial
            constraints. Second, we also find that PE firms with stronger CSR preference have a larger effect on
            physician opioid prescription. Finally, we find regulatory and litigation risks can incentivize PE firms to
            influence acquired physician groups to reduce opioid prescription. We find that the effect is stronger after
            physicians’ states adopt stronger opioid monitoring program and after the first legal punishment of PE firms
            involved in False Claims Act allegations.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
                <b><i>Regulatory-Driven Crowd Out on Small Business Lending</i></b> (with Chen Lin and Mingzhu Tai)
          </p>
          <p class="paper_abs">
            <b>Abstract:</b> We propose and examine a regulatory-driven crowd-out effect that could lead to a negative relation
            between mortgage credit expansion and small business lending even when lenders’ financial constraints are
            not binding. In low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)
            assessments, a shock that leads to mortgage credit expansion results in lower small business lending growth
            compared to non-CRA neighborhoods, especially if lenders are under greater regulatory pressure. Moreover, it
            results in a negative impact on SME employment growth and widens income inequality. We also find this
            regulatory-driven crowd-out effect is more profound in areas with a larger minority share, and
            minority-owned entities suffer more negative impacts on their real growth.

                <b><i>Analyst coverage and informed trading: Evidence from natural experiments</i></b> (with Tao Chen, Chen Lin, and
            Xingguo Luo)
          </p>

          <p class="paper_abs">
            <b>Abstract:</b> Using broker closures and mergers, we find analyst coverage drop leads to decreased informed trading
            captured by the O/S ratio. Decomposed option volume analysis shows that it is the decrease in options trading
            where informed trading is most likely to happen (e.g., open buy call) that drives the decrease in the overall
            O/S ratio. Importantly, the effect is more profound for firms with lower initial analyst coverage, and for the
            coverage terminations of more experienced analysts. These results support our hypothesis that relative to
            equity traders, option traders are more sophisticated in extracting information from analyst reports, and thus
            suffer from a larger information loss in analyst coverage drops.
